# Leveraging high-throughput screening data, deep neural networks, and conditional generative adversarial networks to advance predictive toxicology

A combined deep neural network (DNN) and conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) can leverage a large chemical set of experimental toxicity data plus chemical structure information to predict the toxicity of untested compounds.
